* Major enhancements
 
  * "flow" abstraction for threading (use it to create threads and optionally 
    pass it a variable to be bound output, or override it to modify need_later
    for other threading strategies such as thread pools)

  * Dataflow::FutureQueue

  * Nested binding through variables possible
 
* Minor enhancements
  
  * Better #inspect and UnificationError debugging output
 
  * "barrier" abstraction for manually preventing execution until variable
    arguments have been bound

    e.g. Dataflow.local {|v| v }

# The purpose of this file is to make equality use method calls in as
# many Ruby implementations as possible. If method calls are used,
# then equality operations using dataflow variaables becomes seemless
# I realize overriding core classes is a pretty nasty hack, but if you
# have a better idea that also passes the equality_specs then I'm all
# ears. Please run the rubyspec before committing changes to this file.
